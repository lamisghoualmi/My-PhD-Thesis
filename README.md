## Abstract

Biometric authentication is the automatic recognition of an individual based on his physiological or behavioral characteristics.
Biometric  requires a  high security level. However, it suffers from some problems that can degrade its performances. In this thesis,
several problems encountered in biometrics field were addressed using bio-inspired algorithms.  In the first part of this work, we 
tackle the problem of preprocessing of biometrics images. Therefore, we  propose two approaches in order to enhance the image quality 
of the  ear biometrics. Firstly, we present an  ear authentication system based on Haar wavelets and the  Scale Invariant Feature 
Transform  method (SIFT). The  aim  of the proposed method is to reduce the size of ear image by  keeping only relevant information.
This allows   improving the recognition rate and   reducing the authentication time.   Secondly, we present  an approach based on  
the Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC)  in order  to ameliorate the contrast of ear images   so as to remove the noise and enhance the 
quality of ear images while improving the performances of the biometric system.  In the second part of this work, we address the 
problem of features selection of biometrics data. We  propose a feature selection scheme based on the Discrete Bee Colony Algorithm
(DABC) and  the Opposition Based Learning (OBL) for palm vein authentication. The DABC is used as an optimiser in order  to select 
the best set of features among those provided by Gabor feature extractor. A new objective function was  also proposed which takes 
into  consideration  both  accuracy of the biometric system and the size of the selected feature vector. In the same context, 
we proposed a feature selection and  reduction scheme for ear biometrics authentication. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is  used in
the proposed scheme as an optimiser to select the most relevant features. Moreover, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used 
in order to reduce the feature  vector size. In the third part of this work,  We come up with  different approaches of fusion of
homogeneous and heterogeneous biometric data looking forward to handle the problems encountered in monomodal biometric systems.
Firstly, we present a feature level fusion scheme of iris and ear biometrics. Secondly, we  present  a new fusion scheme that 
combine two heterogeneous biometrics  data  which have different nature (image and signal). The proposed method allows  producing
a new biometric data by combining  ear  image and  keystroke dynamics  features using  convolution. We have proposed  also a score 
level fusion scheme which combine ear biometrics, keystroke dynamics and the new biometric data produced by convolution.
The GA is used in the proposed score level fusion scheme so as  to find the optimum weights associated to the modalities being fused.
